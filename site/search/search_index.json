Default is to rank all mirrors by reponse time. If no arguments are given pacman-mirrors lists available options. Pacman-mirrors requires access to files which are read-only so it must be run with su or sudo . To create a mirrorlist using all default use pacman-mirrors -f The mirrorlist generation process can be refined through arguments and arguments with options, for example pacman-mirrors --country Denmark --timeout 5 IMPORTANT After all operations ALWAYS syncronize and update your system with sudo pacman -Syyu OPERATION Pacman-mirrors tries to provide ONLY up-to-date mirrors if they are available in your chosen mirror pool. This means - at any given time - the number of available mirrors will vary depending on when the mirror last syncronized with the master repo server. If no up-to-date mirrors is available in your chosen mirror pool, your mirror list will not be changed. This behavior can be overridden if so desired by using the -s/--no-status switch. Network connection To be able to download the latest status file from repo.manjaro.org pacman-mirrors verifies network connection by opening up to three different websites. These sites are wikipedia.org github.com bitbucket.org The sites are chosen due to their generic nature and general availability. MODES The number of mirrors pacman-mirrors -f [number] More control (custom mirror pool) -c COUNTRY[[,COUNTRY]...] Full control (custom mirror pool) -i [-d/--default] FILES OVERVIEW The configuration : /etc/pacman-mirrors.conf The file holds configuration for pacman-mirrors. The mirrorlist : /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist The file contains a number of servers which pacman uses to update your system. Manjaro mirror pool : /usr/share/pacman-mirrors/mirrors.json The worldwide mirrorpool comes with installation. At runtime the file is downloaded from Github and compared with the systems file. If the files differs, your local file will be replaced. Manjaro mirror pool status : /var/lib/pacman-mirrors/status.json The mirrorpool status file. It is the data you see displayed at repo.manjaro.org. The file is downloaded and saved on every run of pacman-mirrors. Custom mirror pool : /var/lib/pacman-mirrors/custom-mirrors.json The file is your custom mirror pool It is created using -i/--interactive or -c/--country argument. If you are stunned by this message .: WARNING No mirrors in selection .: INFO The mirrors has not changed This is not an error, it is a feature. The reason: You have limited your mirror pool too much and none of your selected mirrors are up-to-date. Suggested solutions : Remove limitations on countries and/or protocols Do a complete reset of your list with pacman-mirrors -c all -aP all GENERAL INFO ABOUT ARGUMENTS Some options are mutual exclusive and will throw an arguments error: --country , --fasttrack , --geoip --fasttrack and --nostatus Some arguments requires another argument present to have effect. If such conditions rise pacman-mirrors will throw an arguments error. The arguments can appear in any order except for arguments which takes additional options in which case the options must follow immediately after the argument with or without space, for example pacman-mirrors -f pacman-mirrors -f 5 pacman-mirrors -f5 Pacman-mirrors always attempt to download the lastest available data from http://repo.manjaro.org . These data is always used during mirrorlist generation to ensure that you connect to a mirror which is up-to-date for your systems branch. ARGUMENTS, METHODS AND OPTIONS METHODS -c, --country COUNTRY [[ COUNTRY ]...] : Creates a custom mirror pool with supplied countries. -f, --fasttrack [ NUMBER ] : Generates a random mirrorlist for the users current selected branch, mirrors are randomly selected from the users current mirror pool, either a custom pool or the default pool, the randomly selected mirrors are ranked by their current access time. The higher number the higher possibility of a fast mirror. If a number is given the resulting mirrorlist contains that number of servers. -i, --interactive [--default] : This is a function designed to leave full control over countries, mirrors and protocols to the user. This function DOES NOT take into consideration up-to-date mirrors. The optional --default forces pacman-mirrors to load the default mirror file and ignore any preset custom pool, thus allowing for reselecting mirrors for a new custom pool. API -a, --api : Instructs pacman-mirrors to activate processing of API arguments. -B, -S, --set-branch BRANCH : Permanent change branch, using stable , testing or unstable . -p, --prefix PREFIX : Add a path prefix to pacman-mirrors file-handling eg. /mnt/install or $mnt . -P, --proto, --protocols PROTO [ PROTO ] ... : Write protocols to configuration, using all or http , https , ftp and ftps . -R, --re-branch : Replace branch in mirrorlist. -U, --url URL : Replace mirrorlist with supplied url. MISC -G, --get-branch : Return branch from configuration. -g--geoip : Use geolocation if possible, if geoip is not available all mirrors. -h, --help : Show the help message. -l, --list, --country-list : Lists available mirror countries. -lc, --country-config : Lists custom selected countries. -m, --method METHOD : Default method is rank but random can be selected. -n, --no-mirrorlist : Use to skip generation of mirrorlist. -q, --quiet : Make pacman-mirrors silent. -s, --no-status : Ignore up-to-date status for system branch. -t, --timeout SECONDS : Change the number of seconds waiting for a server response, SSL enabled mirrors has this value doubled to compensate for the time spent on exchanging encryption keys. -v, --version : Show the version of pacman-mirrors. Exit status: 0 : OK 1 : Problem with argument 2 : Problem accessing systemfiles 3 : Missing mirror file BRANCH: Value from config Configuration flow of pacman-mirrors At launch an internal default configuration is setup, file configuration is applied then the commandline is parsed and applied. API arguments The arguments modifies key elements of pacman-mirrors configuration according to the users needs. The actions performed by the API are in strict order and performed before any other actions. This also means that ordinary arguments supplied in conjunction with api might be ignored. Eg. -U argument terminates pacman-mirrors when branch and mirrorlist has been written. If p PREFIX add PREFIX to internal file configuration If -S/-B BRANCH apply BRANCH to internal configuration replace branch in pacman-mirrors.conf with BRANCH If -U URL apply internal configuration to a mirrorlist with URL sys.exit(0) If -P PROTO [ PROTO ] ... replace protocols in pacman-mirrors.conf with PROTO If -R replace branch in mirrorlist with -S/-B BRANCH When done pacman-mirrors checks the internet connection and if possible download the latest datafiles for creating the mirrorlist. At this point it is possible to interrupt further processing. If the -n/--no-mirrorlist argument is present pacman-mirrors will now exit. EXAMPLES Most optional arguments are self explaining others require explanation. The API functions is mainly designed to help packagers and iso-builders. However it can be of use for everyone because it takes the hazzle out of editing your pacman-mirrors configuration.
